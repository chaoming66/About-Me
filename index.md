Hi there! I am Michael from Taiwan. I like learning languages, and I often practice language exchange. I want my learning sessions to be productive both for me and for my partners. I’ve summarized my thoughts about practice below.

### A short summary

+ *Everyone has their own way of learning*. I am happy to teach you Russian/English using the approach of *your choice*. Please teach me Mandarin/Japanese using the approach which works for me. We might learn differently and that's ok.

+ *I want to learn how to speak*. That's why I ask to make audio or video calls. If you want to learn from me by chatting, I'll be happy to spend time chatting. But please spend the same amount of time talking to me.

+ *Strait to action*. If you are interested let's schedule a call. I am in GMT+8 and I am available from 7 am till 9 pm. My village has a poor Internet connection, sorry for that. There are occasional disconnections, but most of the time audio quality is good enough to practice.

### What we should practice

My belief is that we should concentrate on having a positive experience. Practice
should be easy, so that you want to practice again and again.

First of all, we need to remove abstractions:

+ *scheduling*

I am very flexible and it's easy to reach me out. It's better to have short calls every other day than once per week. No need to prepare.

+ *fear of failure*

Learning languages takes lots of time and effort. I am fine to repeat the same things over for 40 times. You don't need to write words down on notes, I am totally fine to repeat them for you. You also don't need to prepare.

Then you need to find a reward. It's hard to track your progress especially with the language which has "tricky" pronunciations. It's really hard to measure how much better your comprehension is today compared to yesterday.

I would say, you should find rewards in practicing itself. Find songs and listen to them regularly. Discuss topics that are interesting to you. Find a movie or watch your favorite episodes again and again. And you will notice how your comprehension improves over time.

### How we can practice

This mainly depends on your current language level. People often fear that
"there will be no things to discuss and there will be moments of awkward
silence". I'll give a few strategies for different levels of proficiency:

1. Pointing at things in the environment and naming them.

   I can point at my hand and say "Рука" in Russian. For sure you will understand. There are many objects around which I can show and name. I can introduce some concepts like "color" or "shape". I can show some actions. Frankly speaking, we can spend weeks training like this.

2. Making requests. Asking questions.

   I can ask Yes/No questions about things I've just shown. It's easy to understand and answer such questions. Eventually, I can ask you to do something. Like "show your hand", "close the window", etc. We can practice like this and with enough repetition, you'll learn the basics of languages.

3. Discussing pictures.

   My room doesn't have all the objects you might encounter in your daily life. But I can show you pictures. I'll point at a person and say "This is a person". Easy to understand. I'll ask questions as well.

4. Discussing stories.

   Pictures don't capture much interaction. But stories do. Stories introduce concepts of time and causality, hypothetical reasoning, and other abstract concepts.
   
   You can discuss movies/cartoons, children picture books, you can create your own stories. I like to draw pictures and telling a story at the same time.

5. Discussing certain topics

   We can just agree ahead of time to discuss a given topic. Because we agreed on the topic in advance, we can research information before the session.

### Which languages we can practice

I am learning Russian and Japanese. I can speak English and Mandarin.

## English

Most people gave me positive feedback about my English skills and I have several language exchange partners who practice English with me.

+ I have lived and worked for major corporates back at the U.S.

## Chinese/Mandarin

+ Mandarin is my mother tongue and I can speak very well.

I am patient enough to teach people from 0. I have helped a Belarusian guy from b1 to b2. It takes patience, but you can learn it and I can help you.
 
### Software

Any video conference app will work. I am also running a language exchange server using Discord. There are a few Russian native speakers, one Japanese native speakers and two Americans. Feel free to message me to learn more!

### Frequently asked questions

Q. We don't know each other, I am shy to do audio/video calls.
A. Chances are, we will never meet. We are practicing over the Internet, I am not part of your everyday Environment. The practical chance of meeting me without your own intention is 0. I don't practice chatting for language exchange so probably we will never become more familiar with each other. Just reflect on your negative feeling, and realize what is the real source of your fears. That will help me to understand that the fear has nothing to do with me. 

Q. Do you want to meet friends?
A. I do! And I consider everyone who helps me as a friend. That's why the more we practice the better friends we are. Speaking Mandarin is part of me. And everyone who helped me to learn Mandarin has a place in my memory and in my heart.

Q. Do you want to meet in real life?
A. I travel quite often and I certainly will be happy to meet if we have a chance. At the same time, I am completely ok with Internet friends. Some people just popped up and then disappeared. This is completely fine and I respect their freedom ^_^
