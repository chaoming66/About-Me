Hi there! I am Michael from Taiwan. I like learning languages, and I often practice language exchange. I want my learning sessions to be productive both for me and for my partners. Iâ€™ve summarized my thoughts about practice below.

### A short summary

+ *Everyone has their own way of learning*. I am happy to teach you Russian/English using the approach of *your choice*. Please teach me Mandarin/Japanese using the approach which works for me. We might learn differently and that's ok.

+ *I want to learn how to speak*. That's why I ask to make audio or video calls. If you want to learn from me by chatting, I'll be happy to spend time chatting. But please spend the same amount of time talking to me.

+ *Strait to action*. If you are interested let's schedule a call. I am in GMT+8 and I am available from 7 am till 9 pm. My village has a poor Internet connection, sorry for that. There are occasional disconnections, but most of the time audio quality is good enough to practice.

### What we should practice

My belief is that we should concentrate on having a positive experience. Practice
should be easy, so that you want to practice again and again.

First of all, we need to remove abstractions:

+ *scheduling*

  I am very flexible and it's easy to reach me out. It's better to have short calls every other day than once per week. No need to prepare.
